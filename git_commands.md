Here's your step-by-step DevOps-ready guide to:

✅ Clone a GitHub repo into VS Code,
✅ Create a local branch,
✅ Work on it,
✅ Push changes back to GitHub on the new branch.

`git clone <repo-url>`
`cd repo-name`
`git checkout -b feature/my-new-branch`
`git add .`
`git commit -m "My changes"`
`git push -u origin feature/my-new-branch`


# Git Scenarios with Commands

### Undo local changes to a file
```bash
git checkout -- filename
```

### Undo a commit that hasn’t been pushed
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Undo a pushed commit safely (create a reverse commit)
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Delete a local branch
```bash
git branch -d feature/old-branch
```

### Delete a remote branch
```bash
git push origin --delete feature/old-branch
```

### See who changed a specific line in a file
```bash
git blame filename
```

### See all commits on a branch
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Switch back to main/master
```bash
git checkout main
```

### Test a bug fix without losing current work
```bash
git stash
# do your fix
git stash pop
```

### Link your local repo to a new remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```
